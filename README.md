# Evaluating refactorings for #ifdefs using Eyetracking
## Abstract
The C preprocessor is widely used in practice. Conditional compilation with #ifdef annotations allows developers to implement variability. In practice, developers use disciplined annotations, encompassing only complete statements with preprocessor directives, and undisciplined ones, encompassing only parts of the statements. However, in general, there is no consensus in the literature on whether developers should actually use only disciplined annotations.
